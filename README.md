# Description
A Relationship Manager (RM) advises their high net worth clients on what to invest in. An RM's inbox can receive 50+ emails about investment opportunities per day.

This investment ideas platform aims to cut down on email clutter, and maximise the productivity of RMs by providing an easy method for finding and matching clients to appropriate ideas.

Idea creators can login and input ideas, and RMs will be able to see those ideas when they login. Admin accounts manage all accounts, and are able to create new accounts, or delete old ones.
